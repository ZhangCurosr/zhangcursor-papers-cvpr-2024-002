## Abstract

In this paper, we address the problem of efficient point searching and sampling for volume neural rendering. Within this realm, two typical approaches are employed: rasterization and ray tracing. The rasterizationbased methods enable real-time rendering at the cost of increased memory and lower fidelity. In contrast, the ray-tracing-based methods yield superior quality but demand longer rendering time. We solve this problem by our HashPoint method combining these two strategies, leveraging rasterization for efficient point searching and sampling, and ray marching for rendering. Our method optimizes point searching by rasterizing points within the camera’s view, organizing them in a hash table, andfacilitating rapid searches. Notably, we accelerate the rendering process by adaptive sampling on the primary surface encountered by the ray. Our approach yields substantial speed-up for a range of state-of-the-art ray-tracing-based methods, maintaining equivalent or superior accuracy across synthetic and real test datasets. The code will be available at https://jiahao-ma.github.io/hashpoint/.

## 1. Introduction

Photo-realistic rendering, a significant challenge in computer vision, has seen notable advancements with NeRF [36] and its extensions [4, 5, 33, 65]. Approaches in [14, 36, 36, 61, 65] rely on global MLPs to reconstruct radiance fields across the entire space through ray marching. However, this method results in slow per-scene neural network fitting and extensive, often unnecessary, sampling of vast empty space, leading to prohibitive reconstruction and rendering times. To overcome this challenge, point clouds are introduced as a straightforward representation of surfaces in space, forming point-based neural radiance fields [2, 10, 11, 23, 25, 41, 46, 48, 62, 66]. Point clouds approximate scene geometry and encode appearance features, expediting the rendering process by sampling and aggregating features near multiple surfaces represented by the point cloud. Existing methods in this field typically adopt two rendering strategies: rasterization and ray tracing.

In the rasterization framework [2, 8, 17, 23–25, 32, 46, 64, 66], points are initially projected onto the image plane, where pixel values are determined by the color of the nearest point using z-buffer mechanism. While this approach enables real-time rendering, it often exhibits visible holes stemming from the density of the point cloud. To address this limitation, some methods [2, 13, 23, 46, 66] leverage networks such as U-Net [47] for hole filling by employing feature downsampling and upsampling. However, this approach struggles to generate high-fidelity details. Alternative strategies are to assign each point as a 3D shape such as an oriented disk [17, 24, 32, 42, 64] or a sphere [27]. Nevertheless, determining the optimal size for these shapes is a challenging task. Small shapes can lead to gaps in the rendering, while larger ones may introduce artifacts. Additionally, significant memory is often required for storage.

Ray-tracing-based point cloud rendering [10, 20, 21, 41, 48, 62, 70], directly casts rays onto a point cloud and interpolates nearby points’ features along each camera ray, addressing issues like holes found in rasterization-based methods and enabling high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, real-time rendering poses challenges due to the complex point cloud search process and excessive sampling of multiple surfaces. To enhance point cloud searching efficiency, methods in [10, 41, 48, 62] employ accelerated data structure like Uniform grid [18], K-d tree [16, 19, 68], Octree [34, 49] or bounding volume hierarchies (BVH) [56]. However, not all surface features are equally important for rendering, as illustrated in Figure 1a. Typically, only surfaces closest to the camera significantly contribute to rendering, making subsequent sampling redundant. Other methods attempt to collect the K nearest points for each ray to predict colors [10, 41], struggling with sparse point density for extracting primary surface features.

In this work, we introduce HashPoint, an optimized point cloud searching approach designed to address the hole issue and accelerate the search process by adaptive sampling on primary surfaces. The core of our method involves transforming the 3D search space into a 2D image plane for hash table lookup. Unlike traditional rasterization methods using the z-buffer to retain only the nearest points, we project all points onto the image plane and preserve all points within each pixel. These points are then stored in a hash table. This accelerated structure enables a swift point location near the camera ray through the hash table lookup. What distinguishes our approach is the adaptive searching range, determined by the distance between points and the viewpoint, rather than relying on a fixed radius or K nearest points. After identifying the point clouds near the camera ray, these points are projected onto the ray, with each projected point serving as a potential sample point candidate. The selection of sample points is crucial, as it directly influences the feature aggregation quality on the primary surface. We calculate the importance of each sample point candidate based on the distance between the point cloud and the candidate itself. Drawing inspiration from volume rendering techniques, we retain high-importance sample point candidates, those closer to the viewpoint, becoming the definitive sample points. Consequently, the number of sample points for each ray varies adaptively, ranging from 0 to n, ensuring a dynamic sampling process. In summary, our main contributions consist of two key techniques:

• We introduce Hashed-Point Searching as a novel technique that accelerates the ray-tracing approach by optimizing point searching for improved efficiency.

• We also propose a novel technique called Adaptive Primary Surface Sampling to adaptively sample on the first encountered surface by the ray determined by the distance between points and the viewpoint.

• We validate our approach on various benchmark datasets (synthetic, real, indoor, and outdoor), demonstrating its significant potential to accelerate the rendering process by a large margin with similar or better accuracy.

Point cloud rasterization. Rasterization is a widely used technique for rendering point clouds. The basic concept involves projecting each point onto the image plane while ensuring that closer points occlude those that are farther away via the z-buffer mechanism. A significant challenge in point-cloud rasterization is the unwanted occurrence of gaps or holes in the rendered output. Classical methods such as visibility splatting [42, 71] address these gaps by substituting points with oriented disks. However, determining the optimal size and shape of these disks is complex, and they may not always completely cover the visible gaps in the image. In contrast, recent methods such as differentiable splatting, employed by [17, 24, 35, 64], have made a notable improvement in rendering quality by fine-tuning the shape of these disks through optimization. Recent advancements in the field involve the integration of rasterization with neural networks. NPBG [2] and NPBG++ [46] employ U-Net [47] refinement to learn the rasterizing features, minimizing the disparity between the rendered images and ground truth. These approaches address the issue of holes by leveraging both feature downsampling and upsampling. Huang et al. [23] introduce radiance mapping as a means to combat spatial frequency collapse. However, this technique still encounters difficulties in generating high-fidelity details in coarse regions. As a solution, FreqPCR [66] introduces an adaptive frequency modulation module designed to capture the local texture frequency information.

Ray tracing for point cloud. This presents an alternative approach for rendering point clouds. Early works [1, 30, 55] developed iterative strategies to determine ray intersections with surfaces approximated from point clouds. Recently, methods such as NPLF [41] focus on embedding features at each point and aggregating them during a query, while Pointersect [10] directly determines ray intersections with the inherent surface. PAPR [67] employs point cloud positions to capture scene geometry, even when the initial geometry substantially differs from the target geometry. However, this method mainly focuses on the nearest points around the ray, potentially missing the features of the primary surface, particularly when dealing with sparse point clouds. On the other hand, Point-SLAM [48] and Point-NeRF [62] uniformly sample across multiple surfaces to produce high-quality renderings. Despite avoiding unnecessary sampling of vast empty space, such processes of extensive feature aggregation and MLP prediction on subsequent surfaces remain time-consuming. Thus, there is a need for selective sampling on correct surfaces to improve both accuracy and efficiency in point cloud rendering.

Efficiency for neural radiance field. Recent works [28, 38, 59, 60] improve the memory and optimization efficiency via hash encoding. Some other works [26, 39, 43, 52, 57] are designed to improve the sampling efficiency of NeRF while maintaining a compact memory footprint. DONeRF [39] improves sampling efficiency with a depth-trained oracle network. TermiNeRF [43] uses a density-based sampling network from a pre-trained NeRF. AutoInt [52] predicts segment lengths along rays for sampling. AdaNeRF [26] employs a dual-network architecture with incremental sparsity for fewer samples of higher quality. In general, these methods utilize pre-trained modules and complex optimization for sample point distribution along rays. In addition to neural network-assisted sampling, some other approaches [12, 15, 29, 44] adopt multi-view stereo (MVS) technique [51, 63] or depth sensor to obtain depth information[48], subsequently sampling only on the surfaces of scenes, closely resembling ray-tracing based point cloud rendering. Yet, they rely on dense depth map input and tend to encounter inefficiencies from oversampling on multiple surfaces during rendering. This paper presents our pioneer concept of sampling on the primary surface, further optimizing the use of the explicit geometric representation.

## 3. Method

Following preliminaries in Section 3.1, we detail our Hash-Point method with our point searching technique in Section 3.2, and our surface sampling approach in Section 3.3, and then integrate these with existing methods in Section 3.4. Comparative analysis is explained in Section 3.5.

## 3.1. Preliminaries of neural rendering

Point cloud rendering based on ray tracing typically employs two strategies to ascertain the color of each ray: Image-based rendering. Given a point cloud denoted as $\mathcal { P } ~ = ~ \{ ( x _ { i } ^ { p c } , c _ { i } ^ { p c } , f _ { i } ) \} _ { i = 1 \ldots n }$ , where $x _ { i } ^ { p c } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 3 }$ represents position, $\bar { c } _ { i } ^ { p c } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 3 }$ is RGB color and $f _ { i }$ depicts highdimensional appearance feature. Several methods [10, 41] predict the blending weight $w _ { i } ( \mathbf { r } , \mathcal { P } )$ for camera ray r utilizing the appearance feature, while others, like [41, 67], use the geometric relationship with the ray. The final color of a camera ray c(r) can be computed by K nearest points, represented as K-NP in Figure 4A:

$$
c ( \mathbf { r } ) = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { K } w _ { i } ( \mathbf { r } , \mathcal { P } ) c _ { i } ^ { p c } .\tag{1}
$$

Although methods [10, 41, 67] exhibit some variations, fundamentally, they all harness the relationship between rays and proximate points to determine color.

Volume rendering. Unlike predicting colors from neighboring points of a ray, some methods [48, 62] uniformly sample on surfaces, and aggregate point features $f _ { i }$ to sampled points, as shown in Figure 4B. These methods subsequently employ physically-based volume rendering to compute the color of individual pixels. Specifically, the radiance of a pixel is derived by traversing a ray through it, sampling N sample points at $\{ \bar { x _ { j } ^ { s p } } | j = 1 , \ldots , \bar { N } \}$ along the ray, and accumulating radiance using volume density, as:

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \displaystyle c = \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { N } \tau _ { j } \left( 1 - \exp \left( - \sigma _ { j } \Delta _ { t } \right) \right) c _ { j } ^ { s p } } , } \\ { { \displaystyle \tau _ { j } = \exp ( - \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { j - 1 } \sigma _ { k } \Delta _ { k } ) . } } \end{array}\tag{2}
$$

Here, τ represents volume transmittance; $\sigma _ { j }$ and $c _ { j } ^ { s p }$ correspond to the density and color for each sample point $j$ at $x _ { j } ^ { s p } . \Delta _ { t }$ is the distance between adjacent sample points.

## 3.2. Hashed-point searching

Accelerated structure construction. In contrast to traditional approaches that perform point cloud searching in 3D space, we innovate by shifting the search from 3D space to a 2D image plane for hash table lookup. As illustrated in Figure 2, our approach diverges from classic rasterization methods that employ the z-buffer to retain the nearest points for each pixel. Instead, we project all points onto the image plane and preserve all points within each pixel, storing them in a hash table for efficient retrieval. Our Hash-Point approach to reorganized point cloud is inspired by the Morton code [37] (often referred to as Z-order), which provides a linear ordering of multi-dimensional data for efficient retrieval and storage. Specifically, we arrange the points falling on the same pixel in a Z-order manner to ensure they are stored as closely as possible in sequence. Therefore, we adjust the order of points in the point cloud list. The positional adjustment of each point is achieved through atomic operations in CUDA [40], with a time complexity of only $\mathcal { O } ( 1 )$ for high efficiency. Following these adjustments, we use a hash table to store the position of each point in the point list. In the hash table, the key is the index of the pixel, and the value includes the position of the first point stored for the current pixel in the point list, along with the number of points that fall on that pixel.

Searching. Inspired by [4, 6, 22] each pixel emits a cone for point cloud searching and feature aggregation, which is more in line with the principles of imaging. The use of a fixed searching radius may include features that do not belong to the pixel, introducing noise. For a detailed comparison, please refer to our Supplementary. In this work, we propose an adaptive searching radius that is proportional to the distance of the sampling point relative to the ray origin.

Following [22], we represent the pixel as a circle on the image plane, as an approximation to the area of the pixel. As shown in Figure $3 \mathrm { A } .$ , the radius of the disc can be calculated by $\dot { r } = \sqrt { \Delta x \cdot \Delta y / \pi }$ , where $\Delta x$ and $\Delta _ { y }$ are the width and height of the pixel in world coordinates, derived from the calibrated camera parameters. For each pixel, a cone emits from the ray origin o (optical center of the camera) along the ray direction d, passing through the pixel center $\mathbf { p _ { o } } .$ Due to the sparsity of the point cloud, there might be no points falling within the ray cone, causing holes in the rendering. To mitigate this, we modify the ray cone for broader coverage, shifting from a disc with radius r˙ for one pixel to a larger disc of radius r¨ for the searching kernel. We deduce the magnitude of the searching kernel s by $\begin{array} { r } { s = 2 \cdot \left\lceil \frac { \ddot { r } } { \dot { r } } \right\rceil + 1 } \end{array}$ . Any sample point that lies on the ray can be derived by $\mathbf { x _ { i } ^ { s p } } = \mathbf { o } + t \mathbf { d }$ , and the adaptive radius r of sample point can be computed by,

![](images/0048970c53232856c759643594823aead634e0d94d2131a15fe9c258c2cd68f1.jpg)  
Figure 2. Efficient point clouds searching for ray tracing. (A) Top row shows traditional point cloud search strategies: Uniform Grid, K-D tree, and Octree visualized in 2D for clarity. (A) Bottom row shows Hashed-Point Searching, our method of rasterizing the point cloud onto an image plane and then reorganizing the point cloud list to optimize queries, resulting in the construction of a hash table. Each key (as pixel index) in the table maps to the start index in the point list and the count of points within that pixel with O(1) complexity. (B) The final selection depicts the search mechanism: using a magnified search kernel, the neighbor points of a target ray (black arrow) are swiftly identified through the hash table and assessed based on their distance to the ray.

$$
r = { \frac { \| \mathbf { x _ { j } ^ { s p } } - \mathbf { o } \| _ { 2 } \cdot f { \ddot { r } } } { \| \mathbf { p _ { o } } - \mathbf { o } \| _ { 2 } \cdot { \sqrt { \left( { \sqrt { \| \mathbf { p _ { o } } - \mathbf { o } \| _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } - f ^ { 2 } } } - { \ddot { r } } \right) ^ { 2 } + f ^ { 2 } } } } }\tag{3}
$$

Here, f is the focal length. For derivation, please refer to the Supplementary. During the rendering process, we sample between $t _ { n e a r }$ and $t _ { f a r } .$ . As t increases, the radius of the sample point also increases. As the minimum radius, r<sub>min</sub>, is at the $t _ { n e a r }$ position and matches with our input hyperparameter radius, we modify s accordingly. In the target ray’s search kernel, we traverse each pixel and assess the number of associated points per pixel to determine if the search is needed. If required, we look up the point list for further judgment. The query complexity remains at O(1).

## 3.3. Adaptive primary surface sampling

Another core of our proposed method lies in the adaptive aggregation of features from the primary surface, guided by the distribution of the nearby point cloud. As shown in

![](images/f6fa8c7aead747c1206650cc89c96f7958840707603e7ac8baf5203cdc7888da.jpg)  
Figure 3. Illustration of Adaptive Primary Surface Sampling. (A) The diagram depicts the generation of the searching kernel on the image plane. (B) We project adjacent points to the ray as sample point candidates (red crosses). Each candidate’s importance, determined by its distance distribution to points within its radius, influences its preservation for final feature aggregation.

Figure 3B, neighboring points are projected onto the camera ray, forming a set of sample point candidates denoted as $x _ { j } ^ { \dot { s p } }$ where j represents the index of the sample point. The geometric distribution of these sample points is determined by calculating the average distance between each candidate and its K neighboring points. The average distance $d _ { j }$ can be computed by

$$
d _ { j } = \frac { 1 } { K } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { K } \left\| x _ { j } ^ { s p } - x _ { i } ^ { p c } \right\| _ { 2 } .\tag{4}
$$

While this distance between the sample point and the surface presented by the point cloud adheres to the principles of the Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) [31], it deviates from a strict UDF definition. Therefore, we term it as “pseudo-UDF”. Drawing inspiration from volume rendering [36] and its extension [31, 58], we adhere to two rules:

1. Unbiased intersection. A reduced pseudo-UDF value indicates that the candidate is proximal to the surface, thus deserving a higher weighting.

2. Occlusion-aware. When candidates exhibit identical pseudo-UDF values, the one positioned closer to the viewport is assigned a greater weight to the final color output.

To follow the first principle, the distance $d _ { j }$ is transformed into a confidence $a _ { j }$ by $\begin{array} { r } { \alpha _ { j } = \gamma \exp \left( - \frac { d _ { j } ^ { 2 } } { \beta ^ { 2 } } \right) } \end{array}$ , where $\beta$ is the hyperparameter which depends on the density of the point cloud and $\gamma$ is to control the range of sampling. The proximity of the sample point to the point cloud, lesser $d _ { j } ,$ , necessitates a reduced $\beta$ to ensure distinct differentiation in the confidence $a _ { j }$ cross sample points. To make the distribution of sample point occlusion aware, based on volume rendering, we define the weight function by

$$
w _ { j } = \alpha _ { j } \prod _ { k = 1 } ^ { j - 1 } \left( 1 - \alpha _ { k } \right) .\tag{5}
$$

We retain the sample point candidates with $w _ { j }$ larger than zero, which are located near the primary surface.

## 3.4. Integration with existing methods

The proposed method is adaptable to most ray-tracing point cloud rendering techniques. After sampling on the primary surface and identifying surface point cloud, we can use MLP, as in [48, 62], to predict density and color for sample points. The color of the pixel is then rendered by volume rendering. Additionally, we can integrate approaches from [10, 41, 67] to estimate the ray’s color based on point features. Please refer to Section 4 for more comparison.

## 3.5. Comparative analysis

Our hashed-point searching vs. traditional point cloud searching. Efficient retrieving neighboring points for a camera ray is non-trivial. A straightforward method is to compare all rays with all points, brute force searching, leading to high computation costs. Common approaches employ space partitioning to speed up the search. Below, taking an example with n points and m rays with an average of q points falling in the radius δ of each ray, we introduce the search processes and the corresponding complexity of these algorithms.

• K-d tree [7]: a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. To locate points near a ray using this structure, two common strategies exist: (1) Sample uniformly along the ray followed by radius searches at each sample point, and (2) leverage sub-tree bounding boxes in the K-d tree and apply axisaligned bounding box (AABB [50]) for intersections, then compare points in intersecting sub-trees. Building the K-d tree needs to iterate n points with the complexity of ${ \mathcal { O } } ( n )$ , and in the case of searching points for m rays, the complexity of finding all intersecting subtrees and retrieving q points within the cylinder of rays is $\mathcal { O } ( m l o g ( n ) + m q )$

![](images/d6e0c681e94ee4ea767392922583d4a32ea3df372fa34cc6362475acd69e3c38.jpg)  
Figure 4. Comparison of different point cloud selection strategies. (A) K-NP Extract: extracting K nearest point features per ray. (B) Depth Map Sampling: sampling based on dense depth maps. (C) Multi-Surface Sampling: uniform sampling over multiple surfaces. (D) Our method: adaptive sampling on the primary surface.

• Octree [34]: a tree data structure used to partition a threedimensional space by recursively subdividing it into eight octants. This strategy for finding points near a ray is similar to the K-d tree mentioned above, and the complexity is the same - constructing an Octree requires ${ \mathcal { O } } ( n )$ , while searching requires $\mathcal { O } ( m l o g ( n ) + m q )$

• Uniform grid [18]: a data structure that divides space into regular grids and allocates data to each grid cell. Building this data structure requires traversing all points with complexity ${ \mathcal { O } } ( n )$ . For searches, using algorithms like 3DDA [3] or AABB to find intersecting voxel with rays, the complexity is $\mathcal { O } ( m g + m q )$ , where g is the number of grid cells per dimension.

• Hashed-point searching: In terms of design, prior methods involve the ray actively seeking point cloud in 3D space. In contrast, our method allows the point cloud to seek rays. To accelerate queries, we construct an acceleration structure in the form of a hash table by iterating through all points, followed by searching via hash table lookup. The complexity of this process is $\mathcal { O } ( n + m q )$

Our adaptive primary surface sampling vs. existing point cloud selection strategies. The selection of the number and location of points significantly determines the quality and efficiency of rendering. As shown in Figure 4, we compare various methods of point cloud selection as follows:

• “K-NP Extract” [10, 41, 67] refers to extracting the nearest K point features around a ray to predict its color. As shown in Figure 6, due to the density of point cloud, the K nearest points often don’t necessarily fall on the primary surface, leading to feature noise.

• “Depth Map Sampling” [44, 48] refers to using sensor depth or predicted depth via MVS [51, 63] to assist sampling. Although this method is highly efficient, it relies on dense depth maps and also faces the issue of redundant sampling on multiple surfaces (especially in the case of relying on nearby views with depth input).

• “Multi-Surface Sampling” [62] involves finding all surfaces intersecting with the ray and then uniformly sampling on them. The method provides the best result at the high cost of computation.

• ”Adaptive Primary Surface Sampling” gives a good balance between precision and efficiency by sampling on the primary surface, as explained in Sections 3.3, 4.2 and 4.3.

Ours vs. 3D Gaussian splatting [24]. While our method shares similarities with 3D Gaussian splatting in utilizing rasterization for point searching, a key distinction lies in our rendering approach. While Gaussians have shape, they are often small, requiring more points for ray rendering. In contrast, our method interpolates ray color from nearby points, requiring fewer points. For instance, in experiments with the same Lego scene (NeRF-Synthesis Dataset), our method uses only 35Mb of storage, compared to Gaussian splatting’s 200Mb. The proposed method takes advantage of both rasterization and ray tracing, complementing each other. The combination of the two methods further enhances the approach to promising neural rendering.

## 4. Experiments

## 4.1. Baselines and integration

This section outlines four key baselines in ray-tracing point cloud rendering, focusing on searching and sampling, as detailed in Table 1. We compare the corresponding components with the proposed enhancement as follows:

• Point-NeRF [62]: Searches via uniform grid (UG) and then samples across multiple surface (MS). We replace the UG and MS with our HashPoint (HS) and primary surface sampling (PS) and benchmark as shown in Table 2. PS alone impedes the point optimization due to limited gradient propagation. Thus, MS is initially used for 10K iterations for geometry optimization, then switched to PS for boosting efficiency. The transition is controlled by adjusting the parameter γ. For more details, please refer to the supplementary material.

• Point-SLAM [48]: Employs single-surface (SS) sampling, different from Point-NeRF’s MS approach. While Point-SLAM’s depth-guided sampling is efficient, it relies on dense depth input, not always available during rendering. Our method’s performance as shown in Table 3 is compared with both of Point-SLAM’s sampling strategies: depth-guided and uniform multi-surface.

• NPLF [41]: Starts with downsampling points, searches nearby points using brute force (BF), and renders on K nearest points (K-NP). Our method maintains high fidelity by selecting K (K = 8) nearest points from the primary surface without downsampling as shown in Table 4.

<table><tr><td>Method</td><td>Searching</td><td>Selection</td></tr><tr><td>Point-NeRF [62]</td><td>Uniform grid</td><td>Multiple surfaces</td></tr><tr><td>NPLF [41]</td><td>Brute force</td><td>K nearest points</td></tr><tr><td>Pointersect [10]</td><td>Uniform grid</td><td>K nearest points</td></tr><tr><td>Point-SLAM [48]</td><td>Depth map sampling</td><td>Single surface</td></tr></table>

Table 1. Comparison of key components in various baselines.

• Pointersect [10]: Searches using a UG, retaining K (K = 40) nearest points for rendering. We improve this by selecting K (K = 6) nearest points from primary surfaces, gaining higher speed and quality as shown in Table 5.

We evaluate our search and selection modules, along with overall performance, in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. The evaluation metrics include Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), and frames per second (FPS). Our method, integrated with these baselines, is tested on Synthetic-NeRF [36], Waymo [54], Replica [53], and ShapeNet [9] datasets. We adopt their training approach, with a key difference: in Point-NeRF, we refine the geometry, unlike other experiment baselines. This refinement impacts accuracy; for more details, see Section 4.3.

## 4.2. Evaluation

Evaluation on Synthetic-NeRF [36]. We incorporate the proposed method into Point-NeRF [62] and compare with both NeRF [36] and various point-based approaches [2, 23, 46, 62, 66]. As shown in Table 2, this integration achieves an 80-fold speedup while ranking as the second-highest performance among point-based methods. The results of Figure 5 qualitatively show that solely sampling on the primary (single) surface can produce multi-surface effects, presenting the right balance between performance and speed for ray-tracing-based methods.

Evaluation on Replica [53]. We also compare the integration of Point-SLAM [48] with voxel-based method [69] and the original [48] on the Replica [53] indoor dataset, solely focusing on rendering rather than tracking and mapping. As outlined in Table 3, our approach outperforms Point-SLAM in both PSNR and SSIM with parity in LPIPS. In terms of speed, we analyzed Point-SLAM’s depth-guided and uniform multi-surface sampling (US), particularly for depthunknown scenarios. In contrast to Point-SLAM’s fixed nˆ point collection (nˆ = 5 ), our method dynamically gathers 1 to n points based on nearby point distributions (n = 4). The efficiency of our approach is notably superior - 1.8 times faster than depth-guided sampling and 11.5 times faster than US sampling.

Evaluation on Waymo [54]. In the evaluation of the Waymo dataset, we substitute the BF and K-NP with our methods while comparing radiance-based methods [14, 36] and the original [41]. Figure 6 illustrates that our method accurately samples object surfaces, outperforming K-NP.

Figure 5. Results on the NeRF-Synthesis [36] dataset shows that our primary surface sampling (blue points) is more efficient than Point-NeRF’s sampling (red points) while preserving accuracy.

Figure 6. Comparison on Waymo [54] dataset shows how our primary surface sampling (blue points) more accurately samples the car body than the K nearest point selection of NPLF (red points).

Table 4 shows our method’s superior accuracy over NPLF and its enhanced efficiency compared to BF.

Evaluation on ShapeNet [9]. To evaluate on the ShapeNet dataset without per-scene optimization, we adopt the training setting of Pointersect - training on 48 training meshes from the sketchfab [45] dataset and testing on 30 meshes in ShapeNet. We streamline the architecture of Pointersect by reducing the input of neighbor points (K: 40 to 6), significantly enhancing the efficiency of inference. The results presented in Table 5 indicate that using only the K nearest points of the primary surface produces robust outcomes and accelerates the process.

Comparison with traditional point cloud search for ray casting. In Figure 7, our method outperforms traditional methods (Uniform grid, K-d tree, and Octree) in point cloud search efficiency for ray casting. All comparisons are conducted on a CPU (Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-12900K) without GPU acceleration. The left graph shows our method’s superior performance with increasing point numbers, while the right graph demonstrates consistent efficiency with rising ray counts. Notably, all methods retrieve the same number of points, underscoring that differences in performance result from search efficiency. Our proposed method running on a NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU for 1 million points only takes 4 ms to complete searching (0.5 ms) and sampling (3.5 ms) proving its high efficiency of processing large-scale point cloud data for ray casting.

## 4.3. Ablation Study

Comparison with Point-NeRF [62]. Figure 8A illustrates the comparison between Point-NeRF’s (UG) and (MS), and our (HS) and (PS). HS notably outperforms UG by 5 times in speed with MS, while PS leads to a dramatic speed increase of 60 to 80 times. HS and PS both increase efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, with PS dominating due to reduced point cloud input for feature extraction and MLP prediction.

Figure 8. Ablation study NeRF-Synthesis dataset.HS and PS represent our Hashed-Point Searching and Adaptive Primary Surface Sampling. (A) Combination of UG (Uniform Grid) searching with MS (Multi-Surfaces) sampling, alongside our techniques. (B) Combination of SS (single surface sampling) with Our PS using Depth guided sampling. (C) Combination with UG and K-NP (K Nearest Points) selection for sampling. (D) Combination with K-NP and BF (Brute Force) searching.

Comparison with Point-SLAM [48]. Figure 8B presents the advantage of primary surface sampling (PS), which adaptively collects 1 to n points on the surface guided by point cloud distribution, over single surface sampling (SS), which consistently gather nˆ points. The experiment demonstrates that our primary surface sampling not only speeds up the process but also enhances precision.

Comparison with Pointersect [10]. Figure 8C, illustrates that selecting the K nearest points (K-NP, K=40) from noise-initialized point clouds near a camera ray results in higher accuracy compared to using only PS. However, our

Figure 9. Illustration of geometry refinement necessity. Left: Comparison of methods with and without point pruning and growing (P&G) for primary surface sampling. Without P&G, points (in red) are sampled from a noisy surface (in purple), deviating from the true surface (in blue). Right: Performance comparison.

HS method proves faster than the UG, contributing significantly to the overall process acceleration.

Comparison with NPLF [41]. Figure 8D shows that in noisy point cloud, the K nearest points method (K-NP) outperforms primary surface sampling (PS). Conversely, Figure 6 illustrates that PS is superior to K-NP in correct point clouds. Additionally, Hashpoint searching proves to be five times faster than the brute force (BF) approach.

Geometry refinement. In the ablation study, we initialized point clouds with Mvsnet[63] and followed Point-NeRF’s strategy for optimizing noisy points through point pruning and growing (P&G). Geometric optimization was not applied in Point-SLAM, Pointersect, and NPLF, resulting in lower performance. To isolate the algorithm design factors, we test our method with and without refinement on the base of [62]. Figure 9 shows the optimization improves performance, as it mitigates the impact of geometric noise on feature extraction from primary surfaces. Despite relying on geometric structures, it is easily obtained with a brief 10- minute point optimization during training, enabling significant speed gains without losing accuracy. We also explored the combination of $\gamma$ and $\beta$ parameters to manage noisy input. Further details are available in our Supplementary.

## 5. Conclusion

Our method enhances point cloud rendering speed by combining ray tracing with rasterization. Using our HashPoint technique, point clouds are efficiently organized in a hash table through rasterization, accelerating searches. This approach, coupled with primary surface sampling, reduces input points and leverages geometric distribution, significantly speeding up rendering. For instance, searching through a million points takes only 0.5 ms on a standard GPU. In selection, our approach outperforms K nearest point methods in accuracy and is faster than multi-surface sampling. Easily integrated with existing methods, Hash-Point advances accuracy and rendering speed, pushing the boundaries of point cloud rendering.
