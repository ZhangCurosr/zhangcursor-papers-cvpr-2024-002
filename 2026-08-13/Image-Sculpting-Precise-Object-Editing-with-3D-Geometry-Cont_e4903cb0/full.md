## Abstract

We present Image Sculpting, a new framework for editing 2D images by incorporating tools from 3D geometry and graphics. This approach differs markedly from existing methods, which are confined to 2D spaces and typically rely on textual instructions, leading to ambiguity and limited control. Image Sculpting converts 2D objects into 3D, enabling direct interaction with their 3D geometry. Postediting, these objects are re-rendered into 2D, merging into the original image to produce high-fidelity results through a coarse-to-fine enhancement process. Theframework supports precise, quantifiable, and physically-plausible editing options such as pose editing, rotation, translation, 3D composition, carving, and serial addition. It marks an initial step towards combining the creative freedom of generative models with the precision ofgraphics pipelines.

## 1. Introduction

Recent developments in the field of image generative modeling [63, 66, 68, 89] have unlocked new potentials in creative content creation, offering unprecedented opportunities for the generation of diverse visual content by materializing ideas and concepts articulated through language prompts. However, the integration of these models into real-world content creation workflows still poses significant challenges. Among the most critical is the need for users to have detailed control over various aspects of generated objects, including their pose, shape, location, layout, and spatial compositions. The precision extends to quantifiable manipulations, such as rotating an object by a specific angle or making physically-realistic modifications, such as positioning a character in a way that conforms to basic anatomical and physical principles. Interestingly, such a quest for precision and controllability aligns closely with the core principles of computer graphics, which strive to generate photorealistic images with artistic control.

In virtual effects (VFX) and rendering pipelines, experts meticulously craft and edit every detail within a fully controllable 3D environment, striving for utmost realism. For decades, methods for accurately manipulating and rendering objects have been explored, leading to the development of numerous advanced techniques in 3D model acquisition, rigging, posing, lighting, texturing, and scene rendering. These methods form the bedrock of the modern computer graphics pipeline. However, it often requires custom hardware and software for (1) acquiring production-quality 3D models or designing them from scratch, (2) making these models possible to animate (rigging), (3) creating visually plausible animations (animation), (4) rendering back in the 2D world after applying material and setting up the lighting, and (5) compositing the resulting image with a background or other objects. This process often employs teams of artists and engineers for each one of these steps, as it requires substantial manual input using specialized tools (e.g. After Effects [2], Substance [4], and 3ds Max [29]).

In contrast, AI-based image generation avoids all this manual work, requiring only a text prompt. Leveraging the power of human language and large datasets of curated content, transforming a text description into a visually striking image is more accessible than ever. Yet, when it comes to precise object manipulation, the current 2D-based generative approach faces inherent limitations due to the lack of a third dimension, leading to incomplete information, limited user interaction on a flat plane, and possible ambiguities. The gap in controllability with respect to image generation using computer graphics techniques is striking, and closing it is a major goal of our work.

Most interfaces for image editing frameworks rely on text-based instructions. For example, techniques such as Prompt-to-Prompt [26], Plug-and-Play [79], Instruct-Pix2Pix [10], Imagic [36] and Object 3DIT [50] offer adaptable language control. However, achieving precise manipulation through these models remains a challenge. Straightforward manipulations such as “changing a style to mimic Van Gogh” are manageable. However, more specific instructions such as “lift the object by 5 cm and rotate it by 42 degrees.” are less likely to be successful, as current generative models cannot fulfill such detailed requests through textual prompts alone. 2D-based interactive methods such as DragGAN [57], FreeDrag [42], and DragDiffusion [73] demonstrate the ability to alter part of an object through transitions in the latent space. Despite this, they have their limitations: 1) they can accomplish basic deformations, but the outcomes are not entirely predictable, often leading to results that do not align with the user’s intentions; 2) these latent transformations operate within the 2D feature space, which inherently limits their ability to represent 3D transformations and handle occlusions accurately; 3) they lack physics-awareness, which complicates incorporating external constraints, such as skeletal structures.

Our work draws inspiration from the computer graphics pipeline and ventures into a novel approach for 2D image-based object manipulation tasks. Our proposed Image Sculpting framework, which metaphorically suggests the flexible and precise sculpting of a 2D image in a 3D space, integrates three key components: (1) single-view 3D reconstruction, (2) manipulation of objects in 3D, and (3) a coarse-to-fine generative enhancement process. More specifically, 2D objects are converted into 3D models, granting users the ability to interact with and manipulate the 3D geometry directly, which allows for precision in editing. The manipulated objects are then seamlessly reincorporated into their original 2D contexts, maintaining visual coherence and fidelity. A critical hurdle in this process is the single-view 3D reconstruction method, a task that, despite rapid progress [27, 41, 43–46, 62, 71], often results in relatively low-fidelity, coarse geometric and texture representations. Unlike manually crafted 3D assets used for graphics, their rendered version is far from photo-realistic. Nonetheless, the extracted geometries are sufficient for interactive and precise control. To achieve high-quality final images, a separate enhancement procedure is necessary. In summary, our Image Sculpting pipeline has three key phases:

Phase 1. For the 3D reconstruction phase, we employ a zero-shot single image reconstruction model (Zero-1-to-3 [44]), which has been trained on extensive datasets [17] of 3D objects.

Phase 2. The deformation process utilizes established geometric processing tools, such as As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) [78] and linear-based skinning [48], enabling interactive and precise manipulation of the 3D models.

Phase 3. For the generative enhancement process, we develop a coarse-to-fine enhancement pipeline, using an feature injection approach [79]. Our method strikes a balance between maintaining the original texture of the object and the modified geometry, utilizing a pre-trained text-toimage diffusion model with additional controls.

Our Image Sculpting framework showcases an array of precise and quantifiable image editing capabilities. These include precise pose editing, rotation, translation, multiobject 3D composition, carving, and serial addition. This suite of functionalities demonstrates the versatility of our approach and its superiority in precision and control compared to existing image editing methods. Our method also outperforms various baselines in image quality, as confirmed by both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the new SculptingBench benchmark. We believe that our method can foster new opportunities in merging the flexibility of generative models with the precise controllability inherent in traditional graphics pipelines.

Figure 2. Illustration of three mesh deformation methods applied to a 3D model. In cage-based space deformation (a), the model is placed in a cage and deformed when the user moves the cage vertices [33]. As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) [78] deformation (b) deforms the model when user-selected blue handle points are moved towards designated red target points. Linear blend skinning (c) maps the deformation of a skeleton to the model [32]. Following deformation, a diffusion rendering process can be added for controllable generation. Each mesh deformation technique offers a different balance of control, speed, and precision. Our framework can use any of these techniques.

## 2. Related Work

Generative Image Editing In computer graphics, extensive research on interactive raster image editing exists, and we defer its detailed review to the next section. In computer vision, the advent of image generative models such as GANs [22, 34, 35] has expanded the scope of image editing to include style transfer [21], image-to-image translation [30, 91], latent manipulation [70, 84], and text-based manipulation [1, 58, 85]. Recently, capabilities in image editing have advanced significantly with the rise of diffusion models [18, 59, 66]. The leading systems [51, 56, 63, 68] allow users to generate image variations or use inpainting masks [54] to generate specific parts of scenes based on a text prompt. Other work explores enhancing pretrained diffusion models with text-guided editing capabilities [10, 26, 52, 79]. Yet, text-based editing has limitations in precisely controlling object shapes and positions. ControlNet [90] incorporates additional conditional inputs such as depth [64], poses [11], and edges [86] for controllable generation. For more intuitive interactions, Drag-GAN [57] enables users to drag control points on objects with GANs, and similar techniques have been adapted for diffusion models [42, 73]. However, these methods are mostly confined to 2D and face challenges in tasks requiring more complex, out-of-plane transformations. 3D-aware generative models such as EG3D [13] and StyleNeRF [23] have explored this direction. OBJect-3DIT [50], a baseline in our paper, studied 3D-aware editing using language instructions. However, its effectiveness is somewhat constrained due to its training on a synthetic dataset.

Single-View Reconstruction Single-view 3D reconstruction is a long-standing problem in computer vision [25]. While algorithmic advancements are important, the significance of training data has been increasingly recognized. Earlier efforts were geared towards training models [55, 76, 83, 88] using smaller, simplistic 3D datasets [14, 65]. Recent approaches [61, 80] have started to utilize density distillation from pre-trained 2D diffusion models trained on large-scale text-image datasets, lessening the reliance on 3D data. Nonetheless, for improved view-consistency, the demand for high-quality 3D data is indispensable. The emergence of large-scale 3D datasets, such as Objaverse [16, 17], has spurred methods such as Zero-1-to-3 [44] to combine 2D score distillation with 3D data training. This has led to a surge in new models in this domain, noticeably enhancing reconstruction quality [43, 62, 72, 82]. Our work is also closely related to 3-Sweep [15] and 3D Object Manipulation [37]. These pioneering studies in graphics involve constructing a 3D model using edge information or retrieving an online repository for image editing. We now employ generative models to further enhance shape editing capabilities and user experience.

## 3. Overview of 3D Shape Deformation

The deformation of 3D shapes has been extensively studied in the last four decades, with both traditional and datadriven methods being proposed and successfully used in robotics, graphics, and engineering. We review the main approaches and their usability within our framework.

Space Deformations The older and still widely used approach is applying a volumetric warp function f : R<sup>3</sup> R<sup>3</sup> to all points of a 3D domain [69]. This approach can be applied to explicit (triangular or polygonal meshes) or implicit representations. The map can be parametrized using splines on lattices [69], vertices on a cage [33], or neural fields [19]. A limitation of these approaches is that they are unaware of the object shape, making them more challenging to use on complex articulated objects [9].

Shape-Aware Deformation Shape-aware deformations provide a set of controls linked to the objects’ surface. In Computer-Aided-Design (CAD), a small set of control points define a smooth surface using spline patches [20]. Despite its flexibility and quality, extracting spline patches from 3D models or NeRFs is a challenging and open problem [7]. Partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods simulate the deformation of an object, representing it as a volumetric deformable solid [75] or as a thin rubber shell [78]. The forces guiding the deformation are applied by moving handles selected on a surface [8], making them intuitive to use and requiring minimal user interaction.

Figure 3. Overview of our Image Sculpting pipeline, DDIM<sup>+</sup> represents DDIM with the DreamBooth fine-tuned and depth controlled model. The process begins by converting the input image into a textured 3D model through a de-rendering process. This model is then prepared for interactive deformation by creating a skeleton and calculating skinning weights. The user can modify the skeleton to deform the model, resulting in an initial coarse image. To refine this edited image, we invert the coarse rendering $I _ { c }$ into the noise ${ \pmb x } _ { T } ^ { c }$ . We then inject self-attention maps ${ \bf A } _ { t } ^ { c }$ and feature maps $\pmb { f } _ { t } ^ { c }$ from the initial image’s denoising process into the enhanced image denoising steps. This technique helps in preserving the geometry of the modified object while restoring the visual quality of the edited image.

Linear Blend Skinning The most popular deformation approach is linear blend skinning [32], which defines a space deformation function as a blended average of a set of affine transformations weighted by shape-aware scalar functions, often computed with methods based on solutions of PDEs on surfaces [31] or manually edited. This approach offers complete control and flexibility, as the affine transformation can be attached to points, vertexes of a cage, or segments in a skeleton [6].

Our approach We can use any of these algorithms to precisely control the shape deformation and, thus, the rendered image. We show an example of one representative method for each class in Fig. 2, and we leave as future work additional automation of this step.

## 4. Methods

Given a single 2D image, our objective is to enable precise manipulation of the objects and their orientations in 3D space, before converting this back into a high-quality edited 2D image. To achieve this, we have developed a novel editing pipeline tailored for image sculpting (see Fig. 3) composed of three steps: (1) We initially convert the input image into a 3D model, (2) the 3D model is edited by deforming it in 3D space, and (3) we use a coarse-to-fine generative enhancement pipeline to turn the coarse rendering of the 3D model into a high-fidelity image.

## 4.1. De-Rendering and Deformation

Given an image of an object, our goal is to perform 3D reconstruction to obtain its 3D model.

Image to NeRF With advancements in text-to-image foundation models [66] and the viewpoint-conditioned image translation model [44], our initial step involves segmenting the selected object from the input image using SAM [38]. Building upon this, we then train a NeRF using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) [61].

NeRF to 3D Model We use the implementation in threestudio [24] to convert a NeRF volume into a mesh. This algorithm transforms the volume density into a signed distance function, extracts an isosurface [47], and parameterizes it [87] for texture mapping [74]. The texture is extracted by differentiable rendering [39].

3D Model Deformation After obtaining the 3D model, a user can manually construct a skeleton and interactively manipulate it by rotating the bones to achieve the target pose. The mesh deformation affects the vertex positions of the object but not the UV coordinates used for texture mapping; this procedure thus deforms the texture mapped on the object following its deformation.

However, the resulting image quality depends on the 3D reconstruction’s accuracy, which, in our case, is coarse and insufficient for the intended visual outcome (Fig. 3). Therefore, we rely on an image enhancement pipeline to convert the coarse rendering into a high-quality output.

Figure 4. Comparison of our final method with various baseline methods and ablations. Our approach effectively maintains the geometric information while ensuring the texture quality. In contrast, other methods typically preserve either the texture or the geometry, but not both.

## 4.2. Coarse-to-Fine Generative Enhancement

This section focuses on blending a coarsely rendered image back to its original background. The aim is to restore textural details while keeping the edited geometry intact. Image restoration and enhancement are commonly approached as image-to-image translation tasks [81], leveraging the strong correlation between the source and target images. Our challenge, however, presents a unique scenario: despite overall similarities in appearance and texture between the input and desired output, the input object’s geometry changes, sometimes significantly, after user editing.

In exploring possible solutions, one approach is to use subject-driven personalization techniques like Dream-Booth [67]. They aim to preserve key details from the input, but might compromise the edited geometry. Alternatively, image-to-image translation methods like SDEdit [49] can be used to preserve the edited geometry, but this might disturb the textural consistency with the original image. This dichotomy was clear in our preliminary study, as shown in Fig. 4. SDEdit can maintain the geometry, but it was unable to accurately replicate the textures. On the other hand, DreamBooth produced high-fidelity outputs, but struggled to preserve both the texture and geometry effectively.

To address the balance between preserving texture and geometry, our approach begins by “personalizing” a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model. To capture the object’s key features, we fine-tune the diffusion model with

DreamBooth on one input reference image. To maintain the geometry, we adapt a feature and attention injection technique [79], originally designed for semantic layout control. Furthermore, we incorporate depth data from the 3D model through ControlNet [90]. We find this integration crucial in minimizing uncertainties during the enhancement process.

One-shot Dreambooth DreamBooth [67] fine-tunes a pre-trained diffusion model with a few images for subjectdriven generation. The original DreamBooth paper [67] has shown its ability to leverage the semantic class priors to generate novel views of an object, given only a few frontal images of the subject. This aspect is particularly useful in our setting, since the coarse rendering we work with lacks explicit viewpoint information. In our application, we train DreamBooth using just a single example, which is the input image. Notably, this one-shot approach with DreamBooth also effectively captures the detailed texture, thereby filling in the textural gaps present in the coarse rendering.

Depth Control We use depth ControlNet [90] to preserve the geometric information of user editing. The depth map is rendered directly from the deformed 3D model, bypassing the need for any monocular depth estimation. For the background region, we don’t use the depth map. This depth map serves as a spatial control signal, guiding the geometry generation in the final edited images. However, relying solely on depth control is not sufficient – although it can preserve the geometry to some extent, it still struggles in local, more nuanced editing, such as capturing the specific shapes of a pumpkin’s eyes or the bent legs of a chair (Fig. 4).

Feature Injection To better preserve the geometry, we use feature injection. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, this step begins with DDIM inversion [77] (with the DreamBooth finetuned, depth controlled diffusion model) of the coarse rendering image to obtain the inverted latents. At each denoising step, we denoise the inverted latent of the coarse rendering along with the latent of the refined image, extracting their respective feature maps (from the residual blocks) and self-attention maps (from the transformer blocks). It has been shown in [79] that the feature maps carry semantic information, while the self-attention maps contain the geometry and layout of the generated images. By overriding the feature and self-attention maps during the enhanced image denoising steps with those from the coarser version, we ensure the geometry of the enhanced image can reflect those of the coarse rendering. The pseudo code for our generative enhancement is detailed in Appendix A. Note that our method differs from the original Plug-and-Play use cases: we use feature injection to preserve the geometry during the coarse-to-fine process rather than translating the image according to a new text prompt. We present the injection layer selection and the replacement schedule in Section 5.

Figure 8. Our blend-in process yields visually harmonious results. Top: Results from direct copy-pasting. Bottom: Our results.

Background Blend-In To maintain the consistency of the background between the input and edited images, we first inpaint the area initially occupied by the object in the input image, thus obtaining an unobstructed background. However, another challenge arises in merging the edited object into this background smoothly. Merely copy-pasting it onto the background leads to an unrealistic visual effect, such as the improper water reflections over the fish and the absence of shadow casting from the truck (Fig. 8). To overcome this, as demonstrated in Fig. 7, our approach involves masking the background areas during the denoising steps to preserve their original background. This means we retain the unedited background by blending the unmasked (edited) regions from the denoising step with the masked (original) background. We use SDXL [60] as our pre-trained textto-image model, which includes a refiner module by default. We keep this module in our pipeline, as empirically it slightly enhances the results by reducing artifacts.

## 5. Experiments

Experimental Setup We follow [24] to obtain the initial NeRF representation and to extract the textured 3D model. We use Instant-NGP [53] and a grid size of 256 for the 3D model extraction from NeRF. During the coarse-to-fine generative enhancement process, for one-shot DreamBooth, we fine-tune the SDXL-1.0 [60] model using LoRA [28] for 800 steps with a learning rate of 1e-5. For feature injection stage, we utilize all the self-attention layers of the SDXL decoder and the first block of the SDXL’s upsampling decoder. The SDXL refiner is applied after $t = 0 . 1 T$ . For background inpainting, we use Adobe generative fill [3].

Qualitative Results We showcase qualitative results in Fig. 6, covering six precise image editing tasks. Detailed descriptions of these tasks are presented in Appendix B. Qualitatively, our method combines the creative freedom of generative models with the precision of graphics pipelines to achieve precise, quantifiable, and physically plausible outcomes for object editing across a variety of scenarios.

Our approach introduces new editing features through precise 3D geometry control, a capability not present in existing methods. We compare our method with the state-ofthe-art object editing techniques for a comprehensive analysis. In Fig. 9, we show that 3DIT [50], designed for 3Daware editing via language instructions, faces limitations when applied to real, complex images, largely because its training is based on a synthetic dataset. In Fig. 10, we compare the pose editing ability with DragDiffusion [73] and ControlNet [90]. This comparison reveals that these methods encounter difficulties with complex pose manipulations because they are constrained to the 2D domain. Furthermore, in Fig. 11, we show how text-based editing methods like InstructPix2Pix [10] and DALL·E 3 [56] struggle with precise and quantifiable instructions.

Ablation Studies We create a new dataset SculptingBench to evaluate our new image editing capabilities. This dataset contains 28 images covering six categories: pose editing, rotation, translation, composition, carving, and serial addition (see Appendix C). We perform quantitative studies using different coarse-to-fine enhancement methods. To measure the visual similarity between the edited images and the original ones, particularly in terms of maintaining textural details through the editing process, we employ DINO score [67] as our metrics. This choice is motivated by the self-supervised training objective of DINO [12], which encourages distinction of unique features of a image. To evaluate the geometric fidelity of user edits after enhancement, we introduce a novel metric, D-RMSE. This metric is specifically created to evaluate how well geometric information is retained after the enhancement procedure. D-RMSE measures the discrepancies between the depth maps of the coarse renderings and their enhanced counterparts:

$$
\mathrm { D - R M S E } = \sqrt { \mathbb { E } \left[ ( \mathrm { d e p t h } _ { \mathrm { c o a r s e } } - \mathrm { d e p t h } _ { \mathrm { e n h a n c e d } } ) ^ { 2 } \right] }
$$

where $\mathrm { d e p t h } _ { \mathrm { c o a r s e } } , \mathrm { d e p t h } _ { \mathrm { e n h a n c e d } }$ denote the depth maps Mi-DaS [64] estimates, for the coarse rendering and the enhanced output image, respectively. In Table 1, we show that without any enhancement, the textural quality metrics (DINO score) are quite low. SDEdit effectively preserves the edited geometry with a low D-RMSE, yet the visual quality significantly deteriorates compared to the original image (see Fig. 4). Our method offers a more advantageous balance, significantly enhancing texture quality as demonstrated by higher DINO score, while preserving geometric consistency, evidenced by a low D-RMSE score. We observe that both feature injection and depth control contribute to enhanced geometric consistency and can lead to further improvement when used together. Additionally, we conduct an empirical study to explore the number of self-attention layers for injection. Fig. 12 shows that more layers improve alignment with user edits. We use all layers for injection.
